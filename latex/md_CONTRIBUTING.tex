We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md31}{}\doxysection{We Use $<$a href=\char`\"{}https\+://docs.\+github.\+com/en/get-\/started/quickstart/github-\/flow\char`\"{}$>$\+Github Flow$<$/a$>$, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md31}
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use \href{https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow}{\texttt{ Github Flow}}). We actively welcome your pull requests\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}

\item If you\textquotesingle{}ve added code that should be tested, add tests.
\item If you\textquotesingle{}ve changed APIs, update the documentation.
\item Ensure the test suite passes.
