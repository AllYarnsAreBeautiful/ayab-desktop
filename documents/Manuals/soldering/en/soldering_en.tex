\section{Product Description}

The goal of the AYAB project is to provide an alternative way to control the famous Brother KH-9xx range of knitting machines, e.g. KH-910 and KH-930.

Normally, the KH-910 is programmed using semi-transparent picture cards which are scanned by the machine line by line. Using this information, the machine sets the needles accordingly to achieve the knitting of the picture shown on the picture card.
Probably due to memory restrictions (the machines are quite old today), the machine only supports pictures with a max of 60 needles (= pixels) width, although the machine has a total width of 200 needles. But at least, it is possible to “copy and paste” the scanned image multiple times to achieve a banner-like usage of the scanned data (useful for Norwegian patterns).

The control of the needles and the needed identification of the current position and direction of movement of the knitting carriage are supplied by a cheap and well-known Arduino microcontroller, combined with a custom developed shield (the name for an “interface” in the Arduino world) for the knitting machine.
You actually only need to open up one part of your knitting machine (warranty is void anyway for some years now…) and simply replace the existing control board (the one with all the switches and LEDs on it) with the AYAB controller, then link the Arduino part of this interface (shield) with your computer and start knitting!

The installation of AYAB is fully reversible. By installing the original control board again, the knitting machine is back in original state.

The Arduino has to be flashed with the current version of the AYAB firmware. A precompiled version of the firmware is shipped with the AYAB GUI and is also available [here] (choose the right Arduino type). For flashing instructions, check the tutorial video.

The AYAB project is free and open source soft- and hardware. Source code and schematics are available freely available and free for customization. Of course, we are always happy about feedback and participation in the project!

\section{Before you start}

Before you start with the installation, please read this manual completely - especially the section about error sources and the safety notes. After this, you will know about common problems and how to avoid errors which can only be solved with high effort!

Please do soldering and wiring work clean and precisely. Do not use acidic solder or soldering flux. Please make sure that all solder joints are working correctly. Unclean or bad solder joints and loose contacts may lead to an elaborate and time-consuming fault analysis. It may also lead to the destruction of parts, which may also harm other modules or even the knitting machine.

For assembling this kit, basic knowledge about handling of electrical parts and soldering is necessary.

 \subsection*{General Notes}

You can reduce the possibility of a malfunction drastically by doing a clean and precise assembly. Please double check each solder joint and working step before proceeding. Please stick to this manual!
90% of malfunctions are caused by erroneous soldering.

This kit was built and tested many times before going into production.

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Assembling the parts on the board}

 \subsection*{Note}

While working, please stick to this manual and always keep an eye on the assembly diagram in parallel.

Please pay attention to the polarity/orientation of the three LEDs.

Please pay attention to the marking notch of the ICs. The orienation has to match with the assembly diagram.

Double check the position and orientation of all parts before initial operation.

Please pay attention to solder all parts directly onto the board (without any air gap). All projecting pins and leads have to be cut of directly above the soldering joint.

Because there are some small soldering joints to do, this kit may only be soldered with a soldering iron with appropriate soldering tip. Please take care to avoid short-circuits.

 \subsection*{Solder instruction}

If you are not used to solder wired components, please read a solder guid for wired components. You can find such in the Internet or on our homepage.

\url{http://ayab-knitting.com}

Please note that some parts (especially the ICs) are temperature sensitive. Do not overheat them during soldering!

 \subsection*{Step 1: LEDs}


\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
\textbf{Name} & \textbf{Color}  \\ \hline
LED1          & red             \\ \hline
LED2          & yellow          \\ \hline
LED2          & green           \\ \hline
\end{tabular}\\

Place the three LEDs (red, yellow, green) according to the figure \ref{fig:abb1_1} on the board. Please double check the polarity and have a look at the silkscreen.

After placing the LEDs, please solder them on the bottom side of the board.

\subsection*{Last step}

Please double check the orientation and polarity of all parts. Check for short-circuits and the quality of the soldering joints. Check if all projecting wires on the bottom side of the board have been cut off to avoid short-circuits with the Arduino.

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Test and initial operation}

\subsection*{Checklist}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep] % [noitemsep] removes whitespace between the items for a compact look
\item[\CheckedBox] All parts (especially the ICs and the connectors) have the right orientation.
\item[\CheckedBox] No remains of solder on the shield or any pin of a part.
\item[\CheckedBox] No remains of wire on the shield.
\item[\CheckedBox] No short-circuits visible.
\item[\CheckedBox] Soldering joints look proper.
\end{itemize}

If all of these points are ok, you can put the shield into the Arduino and connect the Arduino to the USB port of a computer. Now, the red LED on the shield should light up.

If no, it is likely that there is a short-circuit or a broken soldering joint - please double check your soldering.

If yes, you can start with the installation of the shield according to the videos on

\url{http://ayab-knitting.com}.
